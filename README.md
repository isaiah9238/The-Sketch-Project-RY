## 🛠️ Project Specifications

### 1. Conveyer Core (AI Communication & Workspace Utility)
Conveyor is a dynamic, AI-administered interface module built to manage notes, ideas, and internet-augmented data retrieval.
* **Window Management:** Supports docking to specific screen regions and a variable translucency state for an unobtrusive background presence.
* **Volatile Notes:** A dedicated notepad feature featuring a visual dissolving text effect for temporary data entry.
* **AI Co-Pilot ("Sparking Ideas"):** Continuous analysis of active notes to suggest context-aware project ideas, alongside automated text summarization.
* **Fluid Architecture:** Capable of splitting into multiple independent notepad instances and seamlessly merging back into the root utility without data loss.
* **Data Retrieval:** Built-in web-scraping and API capability to fetch real-time internet data and map it directly to active project items.

### 2. Surveyor-Sketch Module (Drafting Engine)
Inherited and adapted from the ArithmaGen "Arithma-Sketch" core.
* **Drafting Canvas:** Powered by the HTML5 Canvas API, optimized for high-density field drafting, geometric precision, and sequential coordinate plotting.
* **Design Philosophy:** Strictly code-driven and geometric; completely rejects organic brushes or sprays in favor of absolute mathematical line-work.

### 3. Visual Aesthetic
* **Themes:** Full support for high-contrast Light Mode and Dark Mode.
* **UI Vibe:** High-end terminal aesthetic featuring clean geometric bounds and sharp contrast ratios.
